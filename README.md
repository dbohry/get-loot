# Get-Loot

Is a Minecraft Mod to make it easy to farm items by killing monsters.

## Current lootable mobs
- Spiders
- Zombies
- Skeletons
- Creepers
- Endermans
- Witches
- Villages

## How does it work?

Basically this mod enables loot to drop from mobs adding more fun to your gameplay.
The rarity change depending on how hard/rare is the mob.

For instance, since the `Zombie` is very easy to find and very easy to kill it has a very small chance to drop `rare` items. 
Unlike the `Witch` or `Enderman` which has a bigger chance to drop`rare` items and can even drop `very rare` items.
