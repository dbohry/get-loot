## How does it work?

Basically this mod enables loot to drop from mobs adding more fun to your gameplay.
The rarity change depending on how hard/rare is the mob.

For instance, since the `Zombie` is very easy to find and very easy to kill it has a very small chance to drop `rare`
items.
Unlike the `Witch` or `Enderman` which has a bigger chance to drop`rare` items and can even drop `very rare` items.
